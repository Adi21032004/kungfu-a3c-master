# kungfu-a3c-master
Train an AI agent to master Kung Fu using the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm in the classic Atari game using PyTorch and Gymnasium.
## ðŸš€ Overview

This project implements the A3C reinforcement learning algorithm to train an AI agent to play the Atari game **Kung-Fu Master**. Multiple worker agents asynchronously interact with their own environments and update a shared global network to learn faster and more robustly.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- âœ… Asynchronous A3C training
- âœ… Shared global actor-critic model
- âœ… Support for parallel workers using `multiprocessing`
- âœ… Frame preprocessing (grayscale + resize)
- âœ… TensorBoard support for training metrics
- âœ… Easy to extend for other Atari games

## ðŸ§  A3C: Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic

A3C is a reinforcement learning algorithm where multiple agents (threads) run in parallel, each interacting with its own copy of the environment. Gradients from these agents are applied asynchronously to a shared global network. This encourages diverse exploration and speeds up training.
